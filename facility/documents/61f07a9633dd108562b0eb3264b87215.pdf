00:15:21,441 --> 00:15:23,193
you performed an exorcism

[in English] That was not an exorcism.

226

From Father Gianni's description,
what occurred in Reggio Calabria sounded

Exorcism is my job,

- One moment, Bishop Lumumba.

You do raise an interesting point, Amorth.

255

You are not a doctor,
but these practices of yours

256
00:17:05,087 --> 00:17:07,130

The Congregation
for the Doctrine of the Faith

that the position of chief exorcist
be formally vacated.

is that evil does not exist?

If evil does not exist,

272
00:17:53,677 --> 00:17:57,139
what, then, is the role of the Church?

273
00:17:58,765 --> 00:18:03,020

Congregation of the Doctrine of the Faith.

00:23:45,195 --> 00:23:48,615
- But he can recommend a good psychiatrist.
- [Julia] What is this?

357
00:23:48,698 --> 00:23:49,699
[speaks in Italian]

358
00:23:51,534 --> 00:23:54,204
If your son continues
trying to hurt himself,

359
00:23:54,287 --> 00:23:56,289
- you can administer him this sedative.
- No.

360
00:23:56,873 --> 00:23:58,166
- Mom.
- I'm so sorry.

361
00:23:58,833 --> 00:23:59,834
Baby.

362
00:23:59,918 --> 00:24:01,127
Oh, my God.

363
00:24:08,134 --> 00:24:10,220
[Julia] No, I don't think you understand.

364
00:24:10,887 --> 00:24:13,306
But this is an emergency, please.

365
00:24:13,390 --> 00:24:18,520
No, I need to talk to someone
at the consulate who can help me.

366
00:24:18,603 --> 00:24:20,230
I need a specialist.

367
00:24:21,815 --> 00:24:22,649
Okay.

368
00:24:24,234 --> 00:24:25,193
Okay.

369
00:24:25,985 --> 00:24:27,278
Yes, please.

370
00:24:28,446 --> 00:24:31,449
[ominous music playing]

371
00:24:43,503 --> 00:24:45,505
[bed creaks]

372
00:24:48,341 --> 00:24:49,634
[Julia] Baby.

373
00:24:53,471 --> 00:24:54,305
Hey.

374
00:24:55,515 --> 00:24:57,642
My love, come here.

375
00:25:04,566 --> 00:25:06,901
- [clattering]
- [mice squeaking]

376
00:25:12,115 --> 00:25:15,118
[electricity crackling and humming]

377
00:25:17,495 --> 00:25:18,413
Fuck this.

378
00:25:25,462 --> 00:25:27,130
- Henry, no.
- [growls]

379
00:25:27,213 --> 00:25:28,631
Henry, stop!

380
00:25:28,715 --> 00:25:30,508
This baby's hungry, you fat cow.

381
00:25:30,592 --> 00:25:32,427
What? What are you saying? [gasps]

382
00:25:32,510 --> 00:25:34,512
You never breastfed me, Mommy.

383
00:25:34,596 --> 00:25:35,722
- What?
- [Amy] What the fuck?

384
00:25:35,805 --> 00:25:37,932
- [Julia groans] Ow!
- [growls]

385
00:25:41,728 --> 00:25:43,229
What the fuck is that?

386
00:25:43,313 --> 00:25:45,899
Bring me the priest.

387
00:25:47,233 --> 00:25:49,110
- [Julia] Can you help us?
- [Esquibel] Yes.

388
00:25:50,069 --> 00:25:51,529
I'm here to help, Julia.

389
00:25:51,613 --> 00:25:52,447
Okay.

390
00:25:52,530 --> 00:25:55,533
[suspenseful music playing]

391
00:26:04,334 --> 00:26:05,794
- [Henry roars]
- [Esquibel grunts]

392
00:26:05,877 --> 00:26:06,836
[both scream]

393
00:26:08,004 --> 00:26:10,924
[in demonic voice] Wrong fucking priest!

394
00:26:11,007 --> 00:26:12,550
[roars]

395
00:26:27,565 --> 00:26:31,069
- [in Italian] Is that you, Gabriele?
- [in Italian] Yes, Holy Father.

396
00:26:32,070 --> 00:26:34,280
They tell me you are sick.

397
00:26:34,364 --> 00:26:36,616
Yes, they hope so.

398
00:26:37,492 --> 00:26:39,369
They wish to see me weak.

399
00:26:39,452 --> 00:26:41,454
But, no, they are.

400
00:26:42,497 --> 00:26:44,374
[sighs]

401
00:26:44,958 --> 00:26:46,626
- Help me.
- Yes.

402
00:27:07,689 --> 00:27:11,234
Perhaps we've done our jobs too well.

403
00:27:11,317 --> 00:27:13,945
Cardinal Sullivan
and the younger generation,

404
00:27:14,028 --> 00:27:17,073
they don't believe in the devil
as we understand it.

405
00:27:17,824 --> 00:27:23,788
It's only an idea for them.
For us, it is very real.

406
00:27:24,581 --> 00:27:26,499
Two hundred fallen angels,

407
00:27:26,583 --> 00:27:30,128
expelled from heaven, driven beneath
the soil where God is not welcomed.

408
00:27:31,254 --> 00:27:33,131
It is not a fairytale.

409
00:27:34,257 --> 00:27:38,094
Your search for truth
is delightful, Gabriele,

410
00:27:38,177 --> 00:27:42,015
but pay attention
to your desire to educate.

411
00:27:42,098 --> 00:27:46,436
Pride manifests itself in different forms.

412
00:27:48,062 --> 00:27:50,440
Pride? Me?

413
00:27:50,523 --> 00:27:51,649
[chuckles]

414
00:27:53,943 --> 00:27:56,362
[in English]
There's a case that needs your attention.

415
00:27:57,030 --> 00:27:58,448
A boy in Spain.

416
00:27:59,032 --> 00:28:03,286
Something about it disturbs me greatly.

417
00:28:04,078 --> 00:28:05,788
[pensive music playing]

418
00:28:05,872 --> 00:28:09,834
<i>This boy's possession
is progressing very fast.</i>

419
00:28:11,294 --> 00:28:14,589
<i>The incident took place
in hallowed ground,</i>

420
00:28:14,672 --> 00:28:17,425
<i>San Sebastian Abbey in Castile.</i>

421
00:28:19,886 --> 00:28:23,181
This place
has given the Church problems before.

422
00:28:24,265 --> 00:28:27,518
<i>I sense a great evil coming from there.</i>

423
00:28:28,061 --> 00:28:32,607
<i>Something dark
that only you can help solve.</i>

424
00:28:34,067 --> 00:28:37,904
<i>I have requested the abbey's records
be brought to you in the library.</i>

425
00:28:39,489 --> 00:28:40,448
<i>Look into it.</i>

426
00:28:41,866 --> 00:28:45,912
<i>I will continue investigating
while you're on your journey.</i>

427
00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:52,251
[in English] "Our sins...

428
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:55,838
will seek us out."

429
00:28:57,090 --> 00:28:58,341
[Pope] <i>Gabriele.</i>

430
00:28:58,424 --> 00:29:01,886
Go to Spain, and help this child.

431
00:29:02,512 --> 00:29:06,557
But be careful,
this demon sounds dangerous.

432
00:29:07,225 --> 00:29:10,228
[ominous music playing]

433
00:30:03,239 --> 00:30:04,323
[Amorth] Hello?

434
00:30:04,407 --> 00:30:06,409
[music fades]

435
00:30:06,492 --> 00:30:08,494
[birds singing and insects chirping]

436
00:30:15,376 --> 00:30:17,670
[door creaks, then closes]

437
00:30:35,229 --> 00:30:36,272
[in Spanish] Father.

438
00:30:37,315 --> 00:30:40,526
Good morning.
I'm Father Tomás Esquibel.

439
00:30:41,652 --> 00:30:42,862
- [in Italian] Spanish?
- Yes.

440
00:30:43,738 --> 00:30:46,449
I am Father Amorth. Italian.

441
00:30:48,326 --> 00:30:51,496
- [in English] Wait. Father Amorth?
- Yes.

442
00:30:52,080 --> 00:30:55,083
Ah. I didn't expect them to send you.

443
00:30:55,166 --> 00:30:56,167
[in English] You know me?

444
00:30:56,250 --> 00:31:00,421
- Yes. I have read all the articles.
- [chuckles]

445
00:31:00,505 --> 00:31:03,382
- And the books?
- No, no. No, not the books.

446
00:31:04,801 --> 00:31:05,760
The books are good.

447
00:31:05,843 --> 00:31:08,763
- I will read--
- Okay. I'll just get my bag.

448
00:31:08,846 --> 00:31:11,057
You, uh... [clears throat] Whiskey?

449
00:31:11,933 --> 00:31:13,059
No, no, no. Thank you.

450
00:31:13,643 --> 00:31:16,771
[clears throat]
Yeah, this sore throat, the dust.

451
00:31:20,483 --> 00:31:23,861
Julia, we have been extremely lucky.
The Church sent someone.

452
00:31:23,945 --> 00:31:26,614
An expert in these matters.
Gabriele, please come in.

453
00:31:28,282 --> 00:31:31,119
[in Italian]
Good morning, good morning, good morning.

454
00:31:31,202 --> 00:31:32,161
I am Father Amorth.

455
00:31:32,954 --> 00:31:34,330
[in English] I have come from Roma.

456
00:31:34,413 --> 00:31:35,873
[in Italian] Gabriele, how are you?

457
00:31:37,208 --> 00:31:39,085
I'm sorry that you came all this way,

458
00:31:39,168 --> 00:31:41,838
but I don't even know
why the Church is interested in this.

459
00:31:41,921 --> 00:31:43,506
I just want my son to be well.

460
00:31:43,589 --> 00:31:44,423
[Amorth] Yes, yes.

461
00:31:44,507 --> 00:31:48,594
[in English] Tell me something,
have the doctors given you any answers?

462
00:31:49,095 --> 00:31:50,346
Any comfort?

463
00:31:51,013 --> 00:31:53,099
If you would at least...

464
00:31:54,308 --> 00:31:55,893
just let me see your son.

465
00:31:57,186 --> 00:32:00,314
I can give you my opinion
and you can do with it what you will.

466
00:32:05,653 --> 00:32:06,529
It's worth a shot.

467
00:32:10,158 --> 00:32:11,617
Okay. He's upstairs.

468
00:32:13,077 --> 00:32:15,663
[in Italian] Very nice, this.

469
00:32:17,707 --> 00:32:20,168
[in English] Hello, my friend. [chuckles]

470
00:32:38,186 --> 00:32:39,020
Henry.

471
00:32:40,104 --> 00:32:41,314
Are you awake?

472
00:32:43,816 --> 00:32:46,819
[ominous music playing]

473
00:33:39,163 --> 00:33:42,208
[in Italian]
Our Father, who art in heaven,

474
00:33:42,291 --> 00:33:46,379
hallowed be thy name.
Thy kingdom come, thy will be--

475
00:33:46,462 --> 00:33:49,382
[in English demonic voice]
Your prayers are worthless here.

476
00:33:58,516 --> 00:34:00,518
[growling]

477
00:34:23,624 --> 00:34:24,917
[in English] Who are you?

478
00:34:25,001 --> 00:34:29,672
Your worst fear. I am your demise.

479
00:34:30,798 --> 00:34:32,842
Why are you possessing this boy?

480
00:34:32,925 --> 00:34:37,763
Because it feels so good
to ruin such innocent flesh.

481
00:34:38,431 --> 00:34:42,226
But I prefer the challenge
of an exorcist's soul.

482
00:34:42,310 --> 00:34:44,603
You only serve to diminish yourself.

483
00:34:44,687 --> 00:34:47,023
Don't lecture me, priest.

484
00:34:47,106 --> 00:34:48,524
What is your purpose?

485
00:34:48,607 --> 00:34:50,568
I'm here for you.

486
00:34:52,486 --> 00:34:54,655
Then you must know my name.

487
00:34:55,281 --> 00:34:59,577
I know your soul and every shameless sin.

488
00:35:00,953 --> 00:35:03,080
Tell me one of my sins.

489
00:35:03,164 --> 00:35:04,790
[growls]

490
00:35:06,292 --> 00:35:07,418
You cannot.

491
00:35:08,878 --> 00:35:12,590
Because my sins have been absolved
by the one true master,

492
00:35:12,673 --> 00:35:14,675
- the Lord Jesus Christ.
- Do not speak of him.

493
00:35:14,759 --> 00:35:18,054
Are you afraid of him?
Are you afraid of Jesus Christ?

494
00:35:19,930 --> 00:35:22,308
[in Latin] God is not here.

495
00:35:23,017 --> 00:35:25,519
[in Latin] God is everywhere.

496
00:35:26,437 --> 00:35:27,730
[in English] Whatever you do...

497
00:35:28,898 --> 00:35:31,108
you only do because God allows it.

498
00:35:34,570 --> 00:35:35,988
Did he allow that?

499
00:35:36,906 --> 00:35:38,699
This is just the beginning.

500
00:35:38,783 --> 00:35:40,743
You don't know who you're dealing with.

501
00:35:41,911 --> 00:35:44,663
Then tell me. Tell me your name.

502
00:35:45,247 --> 00:35:46,749
Unless you are too afraid.

503
00:35:46,832 --> 00:35:51,128
I'm not some stupid fuck
you convince to get into a pig.

504
00:35:51,712 --> 00:35:53,798
So you won't tell me your name.

505
00:35:54,423 --> 00:35:57,259
My name is blasphemy.

506
00:35:58,010 --> 00:36:01,972
My name is nightmare.

507
00:36:03,224 --> 00:36:04,058
Ah.

508
00:36:07,978 --> 00:36:09,313
My nightmare...

509
00:36:10,481 --> 00:36:13,275
is France winning the World Cup.

510
00:36:13,359 --> 00:36:15,319
You prideful fool.

511
00:36:15,403 --> 00:36:18,280
You can't hide
behind your jokes forever...

512
00:36:19,698 --> 00:36:21,659
Gabriele.

513
00:36:22,952 --> 00:36:25,121
I know your nightmares too.

514
00:36:26,372 --> 00:36:28,457
[distant gunfire]

515
00:36:28,541 --> 00:36:30,292

517
00:36:45,683 --> 00:36:47,017
[demon laughs]

518
00:36:47,101 --> 00:36:49,812
[in German] Show yourself, coward.

519
00:36:52,523 --> 00:36:54,108
[in German] Show yourself.

520
00:36:55,317 --> 00:36:56,652
Coward.

521
00:36:57,653 --> 00:37:00,197
Show yourself, coward.

522
00:37:01,991 --> 00:37:03,367
[laughs]

523
00:37:03,451 --> 00:37:05,453

[growls]

526
00:37:20,885 --> 00:37:24,513
[in English]
Beware, your sins will seek you out.

527
00:37:27,641 --> 00:37:30,644
I'll be waiting for you, Gabe.

528
00:37:33,439 --> 00:37:35,691
Did you mention my name
to anyone in this house?

529
00:37:36,567 --> 00:37:37,651
Maybe, I'm not sure.

530
00:37:38,235 --> 00:37:42,907
This demon, it says things
that it could not know.

531
00:37:44,074 --> 00:37:46,035
So it's real?

532
00:37:47,077 --> 00:37:48,787

00:47:45,550 --> 00:47:48,553
Tomás! Tomás!
No! No, no! That's what it wants!

709
00:47:50,097 --> 00:47:51,181
Ah!

710
00:47:53,934 --> 00:47:54,810
[growling]

711
00:47:57,020 --> 00:47:58,647
You've been played, Amorth.

712
00:47:59,898 --> 00:48:01,733
You took the bait.

713
00:48:02,692 --> 00:48:05,570
And I'll destroy you.

714
00:48:05,654 --> 00:48:09,533
Your holy Church
will crumble from the inside.

715
00:48:09,616 --> 00:48:12,494
[ominous music playing]

716
00:48:18,875 --> 00:48:20,210
[door creaks open]

717
00:48:24,965 --> 00:48:27,592
[man in Italian]
The abbey's records, Your Holiness.

718
00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:08,133
She was the love of my life.

719
00:49:16,433 --> 00:49:18,602
A promise was made.

720
00:49:18,685 --> 00:49:20,103
[poignant music playing]

721
00:49:20,187 --> 00:49:21,771
She wanted me to...

722
00:49:22,939 --> 00:49:25,609
leave the priesthood for her...

723
00:49:26,693 --> 00:49:27,819
but I had...

724
00:49:29,070 --> 00:49:32,616
no intention of doing that.

725
00:49:33,658 --> 00:49:36,828
So I just told her what she wanted.

726
00:49:42,834 --> 00:49:44,044
My love for God...

727
00:49:46,421 --> 00:49:48,131
it outweighed my love for her.

728
00:49:49,049 --> 00:49:51,343
Are you sorry for your sins?

729
00:49:52,719 --> 00:49:53,553
Yes.

730
00:49:54,137 --> 00:49:56,556
May almighty God show you mercy.

731
00:49:56,640 --> 00:50:02,771
And having forgiven your sins,
may he lead you to eternal life.

732
00:50:04,564 --> 00:50:05,523
Amen.

733
00:50:08,318 --> 00:50:09,152
Amen.

734
00:50:15,575 --> 00:50:16,409
Who is...

735
00:50:18,119 --> 00:50:19,162
Rosaria?

736
00:50:22,958 --> 00:50:25,877
She is a girl that I should've helped.

737
00:50:25,961 --> 00:50:29,047
The demon
is using her memory to deceive me.

738
00:50:29,130 --> 00:50:30,840
How does it know these things?

739
00:50:30,924 --> 00:50:32,842
It can sense our guilt,

740
00:50:33,426 --> 00:50:37,514
and it uses it against us
as a distraction.

741
00:50:38,682 --> 00:50:42,227
That boy,
he does not have long before he expires.

742
00:50:43,019 --> 00:50:45,605
We need to find out
the name of this demon.

743
00:50:46,273 --> 00:50:48,441
Knowing its name, it weakens them.

744
00:50:49,359 --> 00:50:51,027
I didn't mean to hurt him.

745
00:50:51,111 --> 00:50:52,362
I understand.

746
00:50:53,405 --> 00:50:54,406
See here.

747
00:50:54,489 --> 00:50:56,283
I have marked this page for you.

748
00:50:56,825 --> 00:50:57,742
Learn that.

749
00:51:00,578 --> 00:51:02,580
But it is in Latin.

750
00:51:02,664 --> 00:51:04,666
Close enough to Spanish.

751
00:51:04,749 --> 00:51:06,751
Prayer has more power in Latin.

752
00:51:07,711 --> 00:51:09,671
[haunting music playing]

753
00:51:09,754 --> 00:51:11,923
[thunder rumbles]

754

"You have taken the bait."

755
00:51:15,760 --> 00:51:18,221
- What?
- What it said to me.

756
00:51:18,305 --> 00:51:20,557
"You have taken the bait, Amorth."

757
00:51:24,185 --> 00:51:26,104
This is not about the boy.

758
00:51:26,187 --> 00:51:27,605
It has a bigger plan.

759
00:51:27,689 --> 00:51:29,858
I need to check something
I saw in the garden.

760
00:51:30,483 --> 00:51:33,903
Go. Take this. Be outside his door.
He is still in danger.

761
00:51:33,987 --> 00:51:37,574
We must protect him at all cost.
Do whatever you have to.

762
00:51:37,657 --> 00:51:39,576
[thunder rumbles]

763
00:51:39,659 --> 00:51:42,370

[intense music playing]

765
00:51:54,299 --> 00:51:55,800
The seal of the Vatican.

[in Latin] God, by your name...

770
00:53:07,080 --> 00:53:09,582
save me.

771
00:53:11,960 --> 00:53:14,170
- [Henry in normal voice] Help me.
- [thumping]

772
00:53:20,135 --> 00:53:20,969

No one's getting out of here alive!

778
00:54:42,759 --> 00:54:44,511
[laughs] No one.

Oh, my God. Oh, Amy.

go away, Satan, go away!

[ominous music playing]

00:57:22,960 --> 00:57:24,379
It's one of her nails.

[Amorth in English]
Tomás, take them to the chapel.

[ominous music continues]

Everything is redacted.

"Our sins will seek us out."

820
00:58:06,838 --> 00:58:08,464
- Are you okay?
- Yes.

821
00:58:08,965 --> 00:58:12,677
You don't get to stay handsome
in this business for too long.

822
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,262
Please. Hm? Don't.

823
00:58:14,345 --> 00:58:19,267
I once have a demon
try to put a crucifix into my eyeball.

824
00:58:19,350 --> 00:58:21,144
You're always talking and talking. Enough.

825
00:58:21,227 --> 00:58:22,770
- Please.
- [shushing]

826
00:58:22,854 --> 00:58:24,272
They're sleeping.

827
00:58:24,355 --> 00:58:25,481
No more stories.

828
00:58:28,943 --> 00:58:32,405
Did you consider why the demon does this?

829
00:58:32,488 --> 00:58:33,781
To scare us, hm?

830
00:58:33,865 --> 00:58:35,158
For what benefit?

831
00:58:35,742 --> 00:58:36,576
Chaos.

832
00:58:38,369 --> 00:58:39,537
Distraction.

833
00:58:39,620 --> 00:58:41,664
The devil is the great deceiver.

834
00:58:41,748 --> 00:58:43,875
He can make you see things from your past.

835
00:58:43,958 --> 00:58:47,754
Apparitions, memories,
always trying to deceive us.

836
00:58:47,837 --> 00:58:51,549
So we never know what he's thinking,
what he's planning.

837
00:58:52,842 --> 00:58:54,510
If you do not believe me...

838
00:58:55,428 --> 00:58:56,679
just ask my friend.

839
00:58:59,766 --> 00:59:02,059
Come, I'll show you what I found.

840
00:59:02,894 --> 00:59:03,853
Amorth!

841
00:59:03,936 --> 00:59:06,022
[Amorth]
I noticed this when I first arrived.

842
00:59:12,236 --> 00:59:13,112
What is this?

843
00:59:14,030 --> 00:59:15,364
You recognize this?

844
00:59:16,282 --> 00:59:18,576
Yes, it's the seal
of the Spanish Inquisition.

845
00:59:18,659 --> 00:59:22,246
<i>Sì.</i> The darkest time
in the history of the Church.

846
00:59:23,206 --> 00:59:24,624
And they are...?

847
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:28,461
The victims.
The ones who would not convert.

848
00:59:30,838 --> 00:59:32,799
There is something underneath this place.

849
00:59:33,382 --> 00:59:35,510
Something is hidden here. Come.

850
00:59:36,928 --> 00:59:39,931
[ominous music playing]

851
01:00:00,159 --> 01:00:01,035
Hold this.

852
01:00:10,294 --> 01:00:11,879
Two crossed keys.

853
01:00:12,463 --> 01:00:13,548
Do you recognize this?

854
01:00:14,173 --> 01:00:16,384
- It's the Vatican seal.
- [speaks in Italian]

855
01:00:18,094 --> 01:00:20,721
- Is it gas?
- [in English] A little gas.

856
01:00:20,805 --> 01:00:23,683
A little sulfur. A little death.

857
01:00:23,766 --> 01:00:27,061
So no smoking, huh? [chuckles] Stand back.

858
01:00:32,525 --> 01:00:35,528
- [haunting music playing]
- [growls]

859
01:00:39,282 --> 01:00:40,950
It's a door. Push with me.

860
01:00:41,033 --> 01:00:41,868
Okay.

861
01:01:05,099 --> 01:01:06,058
Catacomb.

862
01:01:06,726 --> 01:01:08,936
This is how they would bury the dead.

863
01:01:21,657 --> 01:01:24,452
I understand the Vatican
sealing this place off.

864
01:01:26,579 --> 01:01:28,789
But why would they leave someone?

865
01:01:29,290 --> 01:01:32,043
[Amorth]
The ring of the cardinal protector.

866
01:01:36,881 --> 01:01:40,426
He was the final hope, the last protector.

867
01:01:42,678 --> 01:01:46,557
It looks like he's a prisoner,
but he's not.

868
01:01:47,141 --> 01:01:50,353
The cage is for his own safety.

869
01:01:51,020 --> 01:01:57,860
They do this when an exorcism fails.
To protect against a demon's escape,

870
01:01:57,944 --> 01:02:01,322
to trap something
they need to remain hidden.

871
01:02:04,784 --> 01:02:07,828
Tomás, see if you can open this gate.

872
01:02:17,213 --> 01:02:22,510
[in Latin] "Your cardinal protector writes
to inform you of our worst fears.

874
01:02:27,098 --> 01:02:29,892
It must be buried here forever."

01:02:32,853 --> 01:02:33,729
It's locked.

Then our friend here...

877
01:02:36,983 --> 01:02:38,401
must have a key.

878
01:02:44,782 --> 01:02:46,742
Where did you hide your key?

879
01:02:51,080 --> 01:02:52,415
In the stomach.

01:02:56,544 --> 01:02:57,878
Forgive me.

Go.

Don't you want me, Tomás?

Tell me to get on my knees
and say my prayers.

1111
01:18:31,311 --> 01:18:32,729
Fuck me, Tomás.

1112

Asmodeus, king of Gehemma,
this is the cross of the Lord!

1118
01:18:46,701 --> 01:18:50,038
Release this child
and flee from the light of God!

1119

See thee beneath God!

1120

Never. Get out.

- Get out of my house.
- This is the house of God!

1122

Not without my son!

1123

[Asmodeus] Your son is gone.

1124
01:18:59,422 --> 01:19:01,383
His soul burns and rots in hell.

1125
01:19:01,466 --> 01:19:03,885
- Admit to thy name, Asmodeus.
- Never!

1126
01:19:03,969 --> 01:19:06,221
And bow to the power of God almighty.

1127

You're under my dominion.

And I command you!

We beseech thee to send thy holy angels,
that under thy command and by thy power,

1138
01:19:34,666 --> 01:19:38,837
they may pursue the evil spirits,
encounter them on every side,

1246
01:28:40,253 --> 01:28:41,128
run along.

1247
01:28:41,212 --> 01:28:44,715
[laughs] It would be my great pleasure

1248
01:28:44,799 --> 01:28:49,762
to excoriate your soul
and eviscerate your memory.

1249
01:28:49,845 --> 01:28:53,140
Gabriele, listen to me. Fight it.

1250
01:28:53,224 --> 01:28:55,226
It is just in your head.

1251
01:28:55,309 --> 01:28:57,311
We can only be defeated by ourselves.

1252
01:28:58,104 --> 01:28:59,647
He is not here!

1253
01:28:59,730 --> 01:29:03,859
The little piggy is slopping
at hell's trough, where he belongs.

1254
01:29:04,735 --> 01:29:07,697
I know you're here, Gabriele.
Pray with me.

1255
01:29:09,615 --> 01:29:13,452
God is not here!

1256
01:29:13,536 --> 01:29:15,746
God is always in our hearts.

1257
01:29:15,830 --> 01:29:17,081
Focus on the prayer.

1258
01:29:18,541 --> 01:29:19,917
"Where two of you gather...

1259
01:29:20,918 --> 01:29:23,337
in my name, there am I."

1260
01:29:24,130 --> 01:29:26,173
Lord, have mercy.

1261
01:29:26,257 --> 01:29:29,093
Say it! Lord, have mercy!

1262
01:29:33,097 --> 01:29:35,891
God is with you, Gabriele. Find him!

1263
01:29:36,475 --> 01:29:37,852
[Amorth] Finish it, Tomás.

1264
01:29:37,935 --> 01:29:39,145
Finish it!

1265
01:29:39,228 --> 01:29:43,733
[in Latin] God, by your name, save me.

1266
01:29:44,358 --> 01:29:48,613
[Amorth in Latin]
Judge me in thy strength.

1267
01:29:48,696 --> 01:29:51,741
O God, hear my prayer.

1268
01:29:51,824 --> 01:29:54,869
Listen to the words of my mouth.

1269
01:29:54,952 --> 01:29:58,414
Behold, God is my helper.

1270
01:29:59,165 --> 01:30:00,791
[Asmodeus] <i>Give up. He is mine.</i>

1271
01:30:00,875 --> 01:30:05,463
[in English] I adjure you
in the name of the spotless lamb.

1272
01:30:05,546 --> 01:30:08,049
The word made flesh commands you.

1273
01:30:08,132 --> 01:30:09,592
Asmodeus!

1274
01:30:09,675 --> 01:30:12,595
Jesus of Nazareth commands you!

1275
01:30:12,678 --> 01:30:17,433
And now, I adjure you in his name!

1276
01:30:17,516 --> 01:30:19,101
[roars]

1277
01:30:19,185 --> 01:30:21,812
Lord, heed my prayer!

1278
01:30:21,896 --> 01:30:24,231
- Say it!
<i>- No!</i>

1279
01:30:27,401 --> 01:30:29,695
- Gabriele.
<i>- We're not done yet.</i>

1280
01:30:35,618 --> 01:30:38,245
<i>You're coming to hell, priests.</i>

1281
01:30:38,996 --> 01:30:41,374
<i>I will take you both.</i>

1282
01:30:41,457 --> 01:30:44,210
[dramatic music playing]

1283
01:30:45,920 --> 01:30:47,004
Adella.

1284
01:31:11,153 --> 01:31:13,280
[in demonic voice] Your sins will seek...

1285
01:31:13,364 --> 01:31:14,657
Seek you out!

1286
01:31:14,740 --> 01:31:16,534
[Amorth] Tomás, use the medal!

1287
01:31:16,617 --> 01:31:19,036
Lord, grant me the power!

1288
01:31:19,120 --> 01:31:21,372
- [music intensifies]
- [yelling]

1289
01:31:29,422 --> 01:31:30,381
Gabriele!

1290
01:31:32,925 --> 01:31:35,594
Asmodeus. In the name of the Holy Mother.

1291
01:31:35,678 --> 01:31:39,056
See thee beneath God.

1292
01:31:40,433 --> 01:31:42,768
See thee beneath God!

1293
01:31:44,895 --> 01:31:47,148
Tomás! Pray the final rites.

1294
01:31:48,607 --> 01:31:54,321
In the name of the Father,
and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit...

1295
01:31:55,322 --> 01:31:57,241
see thee beneath God!

1296
01:31:57,324 --> 01:31:59,118
[roars]

1297
01:32:15,342 --> 01:32:17,845
[coughs, then groans]

1298
01:32:18,971 --> 01:32:21,557
Gabriele, are you okay?

1299
01:32:27,438 --> 01:32:28,481
Not so bad.

1300
01:32:29,273 --> 01:32:31,275
[coughing]

1301
01:32:33,319 --> 01:32:35,029
- Tomás.
- What?

1302
01:32:36,572 --> 01:32:37,990
You look like shit.

1303
01:32:38,073 --> 01:32:39,074
[Amorth chuckles]

1304
01:32:41,994 --> 01:32:43,496
Bless you, Tomás.

1305
01:32:44,455 --> 01:32:46,081
You learned the Latin.

1306
01:32:46,165 --> 01:32:47,166
[laughs]

1307
01:32:47,958 --> 01:32:50,669
Yes, it's similar to the Spanish.

1308
01:32:50,753 --> 01:32:53,422
[laughs] Very similar to the Spanish.

1309
01:32:57,510 --> 01:32:58,594
Look.

1310
01:33:03,098 --> 01:33:08,395
You know, the God,
he works in very mysterious ways.

1311
01:33:14,235 --> 01:33:15,069
For you.

1312
01:33:15,152 --> 01:33:18,155
[hopeful music playing]

1313
01:33:23,661 --> 01:33:26,330
Yes, he does.

1314
01:33:28,749 --> 01:33:31,752
[hopeful music continues]

1315
01:33:35,172 --> 01:33:36,006
Cuckoo.

1316
01:33:44,765 --> 01:33:46,267
Is that you, Gabriele?

1317
01:33:46,851 --> 01:33:48,811
[Amorth in Italian] Yes, Your Holiness.

1318
01:33:48,894 --> 01:33:51,605
[in English] And I have brought
Padre Esquibel to meet you.

1319
01:33:51,689 --> 01:33:53,566
You look well, Your Holiness.

1320
01:33:53,649 --> 01:33:56,235
Thanks to you both. I'm glad to see you.

1321
01:33:57,027 --> 01:33:58,821
You had me worried this time.

1322
01:33:59,488 --> 01:34:01,031
Sounded dangerous.

1323
01:34:01,115 --> 01:34:02,908
[in Italian] Yeah, not too bad.

1324
01:34:03,951 --> 01:34:06,579
Sometimes you fly
a little too close to the sun.

1325
01:34:07,663 --> 01:34:09,248
[in English] It has not killed me yet.

1326
01:34:09,331 --> 01:34:11,542
The Church will not forget
what you have done.

1327
01:34:11,625 --> 01:34:15,421
You struck a mighty blow for our side.

1328
01:34:15,504 --> 01:34:18,132
Saint Michael would be proud.

1329
01:34:19,091 --> 01:34:22,303
And this is why God
put you here, Gabriele.

1330
01:34:22,386 --> 01:34:24,388
[in Italian]
Thank you very much, Your Holiness.

1331
01:34:24,471 --> 01:34:29,018
And God has made a good choice
in you too, Father Esquibel.

1332
01:34:29,101 --> 01:34:30,436
Thank you, Holy Father.

1333
01:34:30,519 --> 01:34:35,900
The congregation
has requested a full report on Spain.

1334
01:34:35,983 --> 01:34:37,359
[in English] A full report.

1335
01:34:37,443 --> 01:34:42,197
So Cardinal Sullivan can tell me again
that evil only exists in my imagination?

1336
01:34:42,281 --> 01:34:43,198
You haven't heard?

1337
01:34:43,866 --> 01:34:47,870
Cardinal Sullivan has taken a sabbatical
in the Isle of Guam.

1338
01:34:51,165 --> 01:34:54,084
I shall pray for Guam.

1339
01:34:56,503 --> 01:34:59,924
And who has, uh, filled his shoes?

1340
01:35:00,007 --> 01:35:03,844
I have found someone far more trustworthy.

1341
01:35:05,137 --> 01:35:07,598
I will leave you in his good hands.

1342
01:35:12,144 --> 01:35:15,147
See thee beneath God.

1343
01:35:15,230 --> 01:35:17,107
- See thee beneath God.
- See thee beneath God.

1344
01:35:18,776 --> 01:35:20,819
[church bells ringing]

1345
01:35:22,029 --> 01:35:24,740
[Lumumba]
Welcome to the holiest of holies.

1346
01:35:24,823 --> 01:35:26,533
Twelve centuries of treasures.

1347
01:35:27,117 --> 01:35:29,620
Letters from saints and apostles.

1348
01:35:29,703 --> 01:35:32,373
Books of wisdom and piety.

1349
01:35:32,456 --> 01:35:34,291
Revelations of the spirit.

1350
01:35:34,875 --> 01:35:38,420
The entire canon of Christian thought.

1351
01:35:39,588 --> 01:35:42,216
The Vatican has purchased the abbey
from the Vasquez family

1352
01:35:42,299 --> 01:35:44,301
and reconsecrated the soil.

1353
01:35:44,385 --> 01:35:47,638
The family has safely relocated
back to the U.S.,

1354
01:35:47,721 --> 01:35:49,848
where the boy made a full recovery.

1355
01:35:54,061 --> 01:35:58,482
The friar's diary is proving very useful,
despite his abhorrence.

1356
01:35:58,565 --> 01:36:02,903
Asmodeus has been defeated,
but there are many more to be found.

1357
01:36:02,987 --> 01:36:08,534
Soon we will know
all of the other 199 sites on earth

1358
01:36:08,617 --> 01:36:10,577
where God is not welcome.

1359
01:36:11,245 --> 01:36:14,331
Gabriele, will you take on this task?

1360
01:36:14,415 --> 01:36:16,709
[pensive music playing]

1361
01:36:16,792 --> 01:36:21,088
This would be more
than a lifetime's work for one priest.

1362
01:36:22,339 --> 01:36:23,674
But two priests...

1363
01:36:25,551 --> 01:36:28,595
What do you think, Tomás?
Can you see this now as a calling?

1364
01:36:29,221 --> 01:36:33,225
And that we must serve God
the way he wants us to serve him?

1365
01:36:35,894 --> 01:36:37,312
Let's go to work.

1366
01:36:40,149 --> 01:36:41,900
Let's go to hell.

1367
01:36:41,984 --> 01:36:45,237
[music turns dramatic]

1368
01:37:08,510 --> 01:37:11,513
[haunting music playing]

1369
01:37:40,584 --> 01:37:42,920
[music intensifies]

1370
01:38:25,587 --> 01:38:28,590
[dramatic music playing]
